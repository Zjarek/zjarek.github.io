</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>We no longer as species believe in authority. Diplomas and positions
hold less and less weight in current world. We see hypocrisy in politicians,
church, scientists and give them less and less weight in their words.</p>
<p>It is specially widely seen in this hard times. We are surrounded by more and
more rules and regulations, some of them government mandated, some by society.
We need to save oceans from plastic and we should use plastic gloves. We need to
keep distance in public transit, but we need to get to work on time. We have to
save water, but also thoroughly wash our hands, etc.</p>
<p>All of those rules put a huge burden on our mental health. We are bombarded by
information from news, Facebook, commercials. We don't know what we should do,
there are too many rules for us to follow.</p>
<p>We criticize anti maskers, but they have blessing of POTUS. Who else gets
more authority in US than a president? They are just listening to other arguments
than you do. Similarly anti-vaxers, they want to get the best for their child
and they just don't see vaccination as the answer. Disclaimer: I'm defending
them, but I don't agree with them.</p>
<p>The only source of POTUS authority is that some people voting considered him 
better than an alternative. He is not the best person for this job in the US, he
is considered better than Hillary adding weird rules in US. Voting and campaign
is optimized for close races between two major parties. However with frequent
change and strength of democratic institutions one side isn't far away from the
other side. Maybe they differ on some key issues, but general course of the
country isn't decided by one lost/won vote. Democratic institutions mimic
society, which is divided on those key issues. Somehow we can live together.</p>
<p>Other source of authority is science. However in this case we are always far
from truth. Every bit of observation, every theory, brings us closer. However
proper scientific dialog requires scientific methods. Scientists can disagree
and do disagree. Journal papers are devoid of feelings, only cold facts. On the
other hand scientist do disagree with each other. I remember one televised
discussion, where at the end one scientist said to the other "who gave you
diploma, you idiot". Science was also frequently wrong, one big example was 
scientific racism (now fortunately a pseudo-science).</p>
<p>The last one of three big source of authority is religion. It tells people how to
lead their lives, how to worship, that they life has a meaning. It injects
itself into politics, against the II commandment. It is an opium for masses,
making them content with their lives and happy. There are many rules, positions
and structure in many religions.</p>
<p>I am catholic so I know about catholic structure. From the outside there is one
voice, like in the Communist Party of China. However on the inside there are
many voices. It is pleasure to read how church officials argue, with full
respect for the other person, but with differing opinion. Unfortunately most of
church arguments are long philosophical books, rarely read by a "common" men.</p>
<p>Now there is another avenue of discourse, internet. Facebook has billions of
users. Everyone can talk with everyone and find their place. There are many
opinions, half-truths, or outright lies in the internet. Now everyone needs to
be immune to them. We need to disregard marketing direct and indirect, disregard
paid shills, disregard bullshit. We are getting better at this, but never in the
history of the world we had so much bullshit so close to us.</p>
<p>Somehow we cope. We manage to stay sane, work, sleep, spend time with closest ones and make our life the best
it can be in current situation. We are strong. And if someone else risk
calculation is different than yours, so be it. Don't add more aggression arguing
about it, try talking calmly. Other person isn't stupid, they just have other
situation, goals, sources of information, people they trust etc. Live and let
live.</p>                </article>
